The project contains 2 files:

lognormal_random.c : generate a random numbers with a lognormal distribution. The mean, standard deviation and the amount of generated number can be changed in the main function of the source code. It is also easy to change the function of distribution from lognormal to whatever.

histogram.sh  : take a file with one column of number (typically a file generated by lognormal_random) and sort them in classes. The number of class can be changed inside the code
